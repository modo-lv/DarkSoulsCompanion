        "content": "Instead of how most guides are used — you read what you can/should do next and then do it, I recommend doing it the other way around. Do as much as you can yourself, explore, fight, look for chests. Whenever you come across an item, an NPC or something else of note, mark it in the guide (\"Got it!\" button). Only when you've explored all of a given area and found everything you can, check back with the guide to see if you're still missing anything.",

If you make a mistake, such as accidentally attack an NPC, upgrade the wrong weapon or level up the wrong stats, there is no way to go back. This is by design, but might not always be fair (for example, dying because of a technical glitch rather than gameplay). The only way to work around this is on the PC — either manually create copies of your save file or link it to a cloud storage service like Dropbox that keeps old versions of files and lets you restore them.",

See humanity explanation further in the guide.<br />{Binoculars}: Does what it says, but not very useful in the Undead Asylum (you're mostly indoors) and another can be found very soon after leaving the Asylum.<br />{Pendant}: virtually useless, game creator himself has described it as a \"prank\".<br />{Old Witch's Ring}: Provides a small amount of extra dialog text later, near mid-game.",
