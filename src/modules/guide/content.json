[{"title":"About this guide","children":[{"title":"How to use this guide","content":"Instead of how most guides are used — you read what you can/should do next and then do it, I recommend doing it the other way around. Do as much as you can yourself, explore, fight, look for chests. Whenever you come across an item, an NPC or something else of note, mark it in the guide (\"Got it!\" button). Only when you've explored all of a given area and found everything you can, check back with the guide to see if you're still missing anything.","id":"dd95d669-eadf-459d-83cb-97610aa70c07"}],"id":"4a1e82b9-f399-4166-81e5-babd00231796"},{"title":"General game information","children":[{"title":"Saving and loading","content":"Dark Souls saves the game almost constantly. If you make a mistake, such as accidentally attack an NPC, upgrade the wrong weapon or level up the wrong stats, there is no way to go back. This is by design, but might not always be fair (for example, dying because of a technical glitch rather than gameplay). The only way to work around this is on the PC — either manually create copies of your save file or link it to a cloud storage service like Dropbox that keeps old versions of files and lets you restore them.","id":"bb88d645-a3c0-4ee7-bcff-9680062b7c93"}],"id":"9147bfd5-8b2f-4a2b-a2d8-334f03fb8d33"},{"title":"Character Creation (gifts)","children":[{"title":"Consumable gift amounts","labels":["info"],"content":"Goddess's Blessing: ×3, Black Firebomb: ×10, Twin Humanities: ×1.

You can, however, do it relatively easily if you pick {Black Firebomb}s as your starting gift and use them. If (and only if) you kill him before getting your weapon, he will drop a {Demon's Great Hammer}. The weapon is mostly useless though, as it requires 46 strength to wield and you can get another one way before you can level up that far.","id":"639b2cf7-05d1-4ee9-b4e2-48ebbcb1475f"}],"id":"e2a7ab4f-db11-40cd-87e1-26ae717ad1bf"},{"title":"Early game","children":[{"title":"Northern Undead Asylum","children":[{"title":"Before fog gate","id":"360c3087-8cdc-4eb8-8f3c-1fb1d0a819e9","children":[{"title":"Dungeon Cell Key","labels":["item","checklist","unmissable"],"id":"bb22d01a-7e80-4212-85a7-9c2cc8b33c30"},{"title":"Estus Flask","labels":["item","checklist","unmissable"],"id":"2943dcc5-9709-4301-9204-ce1e8b1f7ace"},{"title":"Undead Asylum F2 East Key","labels":["item","checklist","unmissable"],"id":"7611f825-8aec-4b4d-b3ae-715b99c27d12"},{"title":"Weapon (depending on class)","labels":["item","checklist"],"flags":["abstract"],"id":"62fb279e-d8c2-44cb-a6f8-5cbdbfafac7c"},{"title":"Shield (depending on class)","labels":["item","checklist"],"flags":["abstract"],"id":"7c85eeb9-548d-4b82-8082-227379f02d32"},{"title":"Catalyst if Sorcerer / Pyromancy flame if Pyromancer","labels":["item","checklist"],"flags":["abstract"],"id":"f5266859-8df3-40f5-8e4a-4db2e117972e"}]},{"title":"Fog gate","labels":["info"],"content":"Boss fight with {Asylum Demon}","id":"bef0478d-d015-447a-9e7a-48439c026898"},{"title":"After fog gate","children":[{"labels":["warning"],"title":"Leaving the area","content":"After exiting the main building, you will leave Northern Undead Asylum as soon as you reach the end / peak of the outside pathway.

While physical, fire and poison resistance sounds good, very few enemies apart from bosses actually use either fire or poison, and such attacks are best avoided anyway. In cases where evasion is a problem, there's usually a suit of armor to compensate. Armor also has a much more effect on your physical defense than resistance ever could, and every other stat is more valuable.","id":"99707e6a-46c5-438f-ba89-445d1258c35a"},{"title":"How does Humanity work?","labels":["info"],"content":"Humanity is a stat that is increased almost exclusively by using {Humanity} items dropped by enemies / found as treasure. It is lost and recovered the same way as souls. Humanity points increase all defenses and curse resistance, as well as damage dealt with all Chaos weapons, {Quelaag's Furysword} and {Abyss Greatsword}.
